## Basic idea of the game

### Core Gameplay

- Player controls a ninja character with unique dash-attack mechanics
- Dashing through enemies defeats them
- Strategic movement required to avoid enemy projectiles

### Enemy Types

1. Basic Ranged Enemies

   - Shoot projectiles at regular intervals
   - Static positioning
   - Limited shooting range

2. Advanced Enemies (Future Implementation)
   - Moving shooters
   - Pattern-based attacks
   - Different projectile types

### Combat System

- Dash mechanic is primary attack method
- Time-based cooldown on dash ability
- Projectiles must be dodged or countered

### In game Environment

- Floating platform with small arena where you fight PVE(Player vs Environment)
- Defeating all enemies will move to the next level with increased difficulty

### Learned lessons in this project

1. Use texture atlas..
2. Pre-Calculate things before function calling to make it more readable and optimized.
